        <h2 class="viz-title">CO2 Emissions Normalised by Population by Country</h2>
        <p class="viz-description">When examining global CO2 emissions, it's evident that most countries have relatively similar emission levels. However, the United States, China, and Russia stand out as the top contributors, with their emissions significantly surpassing other nations. On the opposite end of the spectrum, Central Africa consistently reports the lowest CO2 emissions. This stark contrast underscores the diverse environmental impacts and industrial activities of countries around the world.

        <h2 class="viz-title">Gross tertiary enrolement vs GDP</h2>
        <p class="viz-description">Upon analyzing the data for gross tertiary enrollment against GDP, a clear trend emerges. There is a positive correlation between the two variables. Countries with higher GDP tend to have greater percentages of their population enrolling in tertiary education. This suggests that as nations become more economically prosperous, they also invest more in higher education, emphasizing the intrinsic link between economic well-being and educational advancement.</p>

        <h2 class="viz-title">Distribution of Unemployment Rates by Country in 2023</h2>
        <p class="viz-description">From the boxplot visualization, it's evident that the median unemployment rate across countries stands at <strong>0.0536</strong>. This central value provides a meaningful representation of the typical unemployment rate globally, with half of the countries having rates below this value and the other half above. In our subsequent analysis, we will delve deeper to explore and visualize how the unemployment rate interacts with and potentially affects a country's GDP, offering insights into the intricate relationship between employment and economic performance.</p>
