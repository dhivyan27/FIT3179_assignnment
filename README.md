# Country Information Visualization using Vega-Lite

## Description

This repository contains a visualization of various country-related metrics using Vega-Lite. The visualization provides insights into different aspects of countries, such as population, GDP, area, and more. 

## Visualization

You can view the visualization directly on the website: [Country Info Visualization](https://your-website-link.com/country-info)

## How It Works

The visualization is built using Vega-Lite, a high-level grammar of interactive graphics. Vega-Lite specifications can be compiled to Vega specifications, which in turn can be rendered using HTML, SVG, and Canvas.

Data for the visualization is sourced from Kaggle and has been pre-processed to fit the requirements of the Vega-Lite specification.
